The IndieWeb is many things. A collection of websites. A set of tools. A community of people. A philosophy.

I've found that it helps to think of the IndieWeb as a composite whose constituents include the things in that list. 


## A collection of websites

Fundamentally, the IndieWeb is a group of personal websites that people host at domains that they own. Those websites may be hosted somewhere like wordpress or micro.blog, or they may be self-hosted. When I first started looking into the IndieWeb, I thought it was exclusively for web developers who build their site from scratch, but that's not the case. The important things are:

* You own the domain for your site (for example, I own subcultureof one.org). This gives you control over your online _identity_.
* You can back up your content and restore it elsewhere. This gives you control over your online _data_.

Control over your online identity and data are the two key principles of the IndieWeb. The particulars of how you get that control aren't so important. A wordpress site that you back up periodically is every bit as much a part of the IndieWeb as a hand-rolled site running out of someone's closet.
