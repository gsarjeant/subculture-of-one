I discovered the [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/) about a month ago and it's taken me a little time to wrap my head around it, but I think I'm starting to get the gist. I am excited by it - I miss the days of personal websites and blogs and am excited to find a group of people who are passionate about bringing them back. I've also watched with increasing concern and despair as discourse, thought, and action are molded by a few massive platforms run by billionaires. The simple act of standing up a small site outside of that digital hegemony has given me a sense of agency that I haven't felt in years. Now that I've been kicking around for a bit, it feels like a decent time to try to organize my early thoughts. There are a million different IndeiWeb introductions out there, but this is more just to help me make sense of my own understanding and maybe sketch out a few things to do next. If it's helpful to someone else, that's great!
