This is just a quick test of webmentions, based on Aaron Parecki's [your first webmention](https://aaronparecki.com/2018/06/30/11/your-first-webmention) post. The webmention itself is displayed beneath the post content, after the tags. Once this works, I'll try auotomating the sending.

Okay, now I've tried modifying the post template so that all the necessary markup is where it should be in the post. I also don't treat webmentions in long-form posts as replies. I wonder what will happen now.
