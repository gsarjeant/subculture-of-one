There are some IndieWeb notions that I've had trouble wrapping my head around. Webmentions is the big one, but microformats messed with me for a while and every time I think I might want to take a swing at IndieAuth I get cowed by the initial reading.

So I thought I'd do a series of posts that explain these things to myself. I've also noticed that a lot of people are spinning up their first website or looking into self-hosting for the first time. There are a lot of questions about routing and virtual hosts and securing a home server or network that I actually do have a bit of experience with. So perhaps I can address some of those topics and help other people, too.

I've become a fan of the ELI5 shorthand for "Explain Like I'm 5", so I settled on an ELI5 series. The idea is not to write comprehensive docs to make anyone an expert on things. I'm just aiming to write enough explanation to make things make sense to me. I plan to lean heavily on analogies to more familiar things. I find that if I can relate something I'm struggling with to something I already understand - even if the relation is a bit strained - it helps me alot.

The name ELI5ium is a portmanteau of ELI5 and [Elysium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elysium) that just sort of popped into my head. It's also just leet speaky enough to feel topically appropriate without being annoying. So here you are. Welcome to ELI5ium! May you find relief from the IndieWeb things that have been vexing you - or at least the ones that have been vexing me.
