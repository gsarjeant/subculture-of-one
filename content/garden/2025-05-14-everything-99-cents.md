I was passing by a shop in a local strip mall when a sign in the window caught my eye. In the middle, in large black print, it said "Everything 99¢." Beneath that, "or less" was written in smaller blue print and different handwriting. And finally, in the lower right corner a third hand had written "and up" in even smaller green print.

I laughed for a good minute. Now I use that phrase wherever I can - you might have noticed it on this site's homepage. It's my job title in Slack. It's my [bio on mastodon](https://social.subcultureofone.org/@greg). It cheers me every time I see it. I loved that sign and have never forgotten it for a couple reasons.

First, it's universally true! You could stick that sign in any store window anywhere on earth and it would work. Sure, it would be absured in, say, a car dealership. But it would still be correct.

But I really loved it because it was a real-life encounter with a [six-word story](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_sale:_baby_shoes,_never_worn) (technically seven, but I'm taking liberties with "99¢"). You could read the entire history of that store in those 3 lines. It started life as a shop where everything was 99 cents. Then one day they sold something for 50 cents or 75 cents or some other sub-99-cents amount and someone had to go and change the sign. Then they started selling things for a dollar or more. I could almost see the manager rolling their eyes and sighing with exasperation as they pulled the sign out of the window to tack on "and up."

It was just a paper sign in the window of an otherwise nondescript store in a typical New Jersey strip mall, but it's brought me years of joy.
