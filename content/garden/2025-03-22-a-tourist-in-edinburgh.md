I'm in Edinburgh, Scotland for the first time. I've spent the day being a tourist with my wife: I grew up in Orlando, so whenever I get to be a tourist in someone else's city I feel like the universe is settling accounts. We went to [Edinburgh Castle](https://www.edinburghcastle.scot), bought some stuff with [highland cows](https://www.visitscotland.com/things-to-do/landscapes-nature/wildlife/places-to-see-highland-cows) on it, went to [Grassmarket](https://outaboutscotland.com/the-grassmarket-in-edinburgh/) and the [Farmer's Market](https://www.edinburghfarmersmarket.co.uk), saw the [Wojtek statue](https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/soldier-bear-statue), and walked all around the [Waverly Station](https://www.thetrainline.com/en-us/via/europe/uk/scotland/edinburgh/waverley-station-guide) area.

It's only been a day, but this is already high on my list of favorite cities. It's somehow a modern city built within an ancient one. It brings to mind every story I've ever read that involved a shadow world intermingling with the everyday. If I lived here, I think I'd be content to spend a lot of my days just walking around, telling myself stories about all things happening just beyond - or just beneath - the periphery of my awareness.

Tomorrow we're meeting up with some friends who know the area and will be spending the next few days with them. I'm looking forward to getting the insider view, but it's been fun to be a tourist for a day.
