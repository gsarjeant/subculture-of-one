I made a quick change to the taxonomy of the site today. I intended the site to be a [digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history). I love the idea - especially the emphasis on lighter, less polished entries that can change over time. But I kept seeing references to saplings in other people's gardens and I started wondering whether that was more appropriate for a forest than a garden. And then I figured "trees/saplings/stumps" would be a good taxonomy for my posts. So I called it a forest.

But today I realized that I kind of defeated the whole purpose of the lightweight, flexible digital garden by getting all in my head about the taxonomy. The tree/sapling/stump thing doesn't really do anything for me other than stress me out about how to classify posts. And the more I thnk about the garden metaphor, the more I prefer it. Maybe that's just because spring is coming and I'm getting ready for a physical garden overhaul.

Whatever the reason, here I am! In a digital garden where I'm just going to let the plants grow without worrying about what stage of life they're in.

And in an extra bit of fun, I [broke all my existing webmentions](/2025/02/15/testing-webmentions) in the process! I think I know what I need to do to fix them, but I don't know how to do it yet. That'll be a neat little project.
