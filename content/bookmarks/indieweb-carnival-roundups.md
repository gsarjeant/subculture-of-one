    summary: January 2025 - On the importance of friction
---

Each month, the IndieWeb Community hosts a [blog carnival](https://indieweb.org/IndieWeb_Carnival), where a member of the IndieWeb community sets a writing prompt and people from the community write posts that relate to the prompt. Each roundup page gathers all of the posts submitted for a given month. I plan to submit something each month, but even if I don't, I'd like to have a convenient way to get to all the submissions.

I'm just going to start with 2025, since this is the year I discovered them and I'm already behind on reading people's posts. I may go back and add previous years.
